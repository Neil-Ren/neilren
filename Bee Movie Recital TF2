alias "n1" "say According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat"
alias "n2" "say little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible. Yellow,"
alias "n3" "say black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Coh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is"
alias "n4" "say ready! Coming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry? - Adam? - Can you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up."
alias "n5" "say Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud"
alias "n6" "say of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! "
alias "n7" "say That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, "
alias "n8" "say Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days "
alias "n9" "say high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back"
alias "n10" "say different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral? -"
alias "n11" "say No, I'm not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have"
alias "n12" "say just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, "
alias "n13" "say quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are! - Bee-men. - Amen! Hallelujah!"
alias "n14" "say Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive City graduating class of... ...9:15."
alias "n15" "say That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it's just"
alias "n16" "say orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like? -"
alias "n17" "say A little scary. Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that"
alias "n18" "say you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey begins when our"
alias "n19" "say valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and "
alias "n20" "say bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey! - That girl was hot. -"
alias "n21" "say She's my cousin! - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every"
alias "n22" "say aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes? - Not enough."
alias "n23" "say Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman. - What does that do? - Catches that little strand of honey that hangs after"
alias "n24" "say you pour it. Saves us millions. Can anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that"
alias "n25" "say every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of"
alias "n26" "say your life. The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees, as"
alias "n27" "say a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my"
alias "n28" "say mind! "What's the difference?" How can you say that? One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved."
alias "n29" "say Now we only have to make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could they never have told us that? Why would you question"
alias "n30" "say anything? We're bees. We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe things work a little too well"
alias "n31" "say here? Like what? Give me one example. I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about. Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar"
alias "n32" "say Force on approach. Wait a second. Check it out. - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow. I've never seen them this close. They"
alias "n33" "say know what it's like outside the hive. Yeah, but some don't come back. - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're"
alias "n34" "say monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were. - I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside"
alias "n35" "say the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what. You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that."
alias "n36" "say Right. Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it."
alias "n37" "say Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too? Distant."
alias "n38" "say Distant. Look at these two. - Couple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them. It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock."
alias "n39" "say Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me! - Oh, my! - "
alias "n40" "say I never thought I'd knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that."
alias "n41" "say A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow."
alias "n42" "say - Six miles, huh? - Barry! A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it. - Maybe I am. - You are not! We're going 0900 "
alias "n43" "say at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough? I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means. Hey, Honex!"
alias "n44" "say Dad, you surprised me. You decide what you're interested in? - Well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one. Do you"
alias "n45" "say ever get bored doing the same job every day? Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that stick, and you just move it"
alias "n46" "say around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing. You know, Dad, the more I think about"
alias "n47" "say it, maybe the honey field just isn't right for me. You were thinking of what, making balloon animals? That's a bad job for a"
alias "n48" "say guy with a stinger. Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey! - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying"
alias "n49" "say to be funny. You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer! - You're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening"
alias "n50" "say to me! Wait till you see the sticks I have. I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo! Let's open some honey "
alias "n51" "say and celebrate! Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody"
alias "n52" "say "dawg"! I'm so proud. - We're starting work today! - Today's the day. Come on! All the good jobs will be gone. Yeah, right."
alias "n53" "say Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal... - Is it still available? - Hang on. Two left! One of "
alias "n54" "say them's yours! Congratulations! Step to the side. - What'd you get? - Picking crud out. Stellar! Wow! Couple of newbies? Yes,"
alias "n55" "say sir! Our first day! We are ready! Make your choice. - You want to go first? - No, you go. Oh, my. What's available? Restroom"
alias "n56" "say attendant's open, not for the reason you think. - Any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you're on. I'm sorry, the Krelman "
alias "n57" "say just closed out. Wax monkey's always open. The Krelman opened up again. What happened? A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's "
alias "n58" "say dead. Another dead one. Deady. Deadified. Two more dead. Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life! Oh, this "
alias "n59" "say is so hard! Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor,"
alias "n60" "say mite wrangler. Barry, what do you think I should... Barry? Barry! All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine... "
alias "n61" "say What happened to you? Where are you? - I'm going out. - Out? Out where? - Out there. - Oh, no! I have to, before I go to work"
alias "n62" "say for the rest of my life. You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello? Another call coming in. If anyone's feeling brave, there's a"
alias "n63" "say Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today. Hey, guys. - Look at that. - Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday? Hold it,"
alias "n64" "say son, flight deck's restricted. It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up. Really? Feeling lucky, are you? Sign here, here. Just"
alias "n65" "say initial that. - Thank you. - OK. You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain. So be careful."
alias "n66" "say As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats. Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being"
alias "n67" "say poured on us. Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada! - That's awful. - And a reminder for you rookies, bee"
alias "n68" "say law number one, absolutely no talking to humans! All right, launch positions! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!"
alias "n69" "say Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Black and yellow! Hello! You ready for this, hot shot? Yeah. Yeah, bring it on. Wind, check."
alias "n70" "say Antennae, check. - Nectar pack, check. - Wings, check. - Stinger, check. Scared out of my shorts, check. OK, ladies, let's move"

alias "n74" "say collector! - Ever see pollination up close? - No, sir. I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over the"
alias "n75" "say re, a pinch on that one. See that? It's a little bit of magic. That's amazing. Why do we do that? That's pollen power. More pol"
alias "n76" "say len, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us. Cool. I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow. Could be daisies. Don't we"
alias "n77" "say need those? Copy that visual. Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move. Say again? You're reporting a moving flower? "
alias "n78" "say Affirmative. That was on the line! This is the coolest. What is it? I don't know, but I'm loving this color. It smells good."
alias "n79" "say Not like a flower, but I like it. Yeah, fuzzy. Chemical-y. Careful, guys. It's a little grabby. My sweet lord of bees!"
alias "n80" "say Candy-brain, get off there! Problem! - Guys! - This could be bad. Affirmative. Very close. Gonna hurt. Mama's little boy. "
alias "n81" "say You are way out of position, rookie! Coming in at you like a missile! Help me! I don't think these are flowers. - Should we"
alias "n82" "say tell him? - I think he knows. What is this?! Match point! You can start packing up, honey, because you're about to eat it!"
alias "n83" "say Yowser! Gross. There's a bee in the car! - Do something! - I'm driving! - Hi, bee. - He's back here! He's going to sting me!"
alias "n84" "say Nobody move. If you don't move, he won't sting you. Freeze! He blinked! Spray him, Granny! What are you doing?! Wow... the"
alias "n85" "say tension level out here is unbelievable. I gotta get home. Can't fly in rain. Can't fly in rain. Can't fly in rain. Mayday!"
alias "n86" "say Mayday! Bee going down! Ken, could you close the window please? Ken, could you close the window please? Check out my new resume"
alias "n87" "say I made it into a fold-out brochure. You see? Folds out. Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this. What was that? Maybe this time." 
alias "n88" "say This time. This time. This time! This time! This... Drapes! That is diabolical. It's fantastic. It's got all my special skills,"
alias "n89" "say even my top-ten favorite movies. What's number one? Star Wars? Nah, I don't go for that... ...kind of stuff. No wonder we "
alias "n90" "say shouldn't talk to them. They're out of their minds. When I leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believe what I"
alias "n91" "say say. There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out. I don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it. I predicted global warming. I"
alias "n92" "say could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me. Wait! Stop! Bee! Stand back. These are winter boots. Wait!"
alias "n93" "say Don't kill him! You know I'm allergic to them! This thing could kill me! Why does his life have less value than yours? Why does"
alias "n94" "say his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement? I'm just saying all life has value. You don't know what he's"
alias "n95" "say capable of feeling. My brochure! There you go, little guy. I'm not scared of him. It's an allergic thing. Put that on your"
alias "n96" "say resume brochure. My whole face could puff up. Make it one of your special skills. Knocking someone out is also a special skill."
alias "n97" "say Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks. - Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night? - Sure, Ken. You know, whatever. - You could put carob chips"
alias "n98" "say on there. - Bye. - Supposed to be less calories. - Bye. I gotta say something. She saved my life. I gotta say something."
alias "n99" "say All right, here it goes. Nah. What would I say? I could really get in trouble. It's a bee law. You're not supposed to talk to a"
alias "n100" "say human. I can't believe I'm doing this. I've got to. Ch, I can't do it. Come on! No. Yes. No. Do it. I can't. How should I start"
alias "n101" "say it? "YA LIKE JAZZ?" No, that's no good. Here she comes! Speak, you fool! Hi! I'm sorry. - You're talking. - Yes, I know."
alias "n102" "say You're talking! I'm so sorry. No, it's OK. It's fine. I know I'm dreaming. But I don't recall going to bed. Well, I'm sure this"
alias "n103" "say is very disconcerting. This is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you're a bee! I am. And I'm not supposed to be doing this,"
alias "n104" "say but they were all trying to kill me. And if it wasn't for you... I had to thank you. It's just how I was raised. That was a"
alias "n105" "say little weird. - I'm talking with a bee. - Yeah. I'm talking to a bee. And the bee is talking to me! I just want to say I'm"
alias "n106" "say grateful. I'll leave now. - Wait! How did you learn to do that? - What? The talking thing. Same way you did, I guess. "Mama,"
alias "n107" "say Dada, honey." You pick it up. - That's very funny. - Yeah. Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we have to"
alias "n108" "say deal with. Anyway... Can I... ...get you something? - Like what? I don't know. I mean... I don't know. Coffee? I don't want to "
alias "n109" "say put you out. It's no trouble. It takes two minutes. - It's just coffee. - I hate to impose. - Don't be ridiculous! - Actually, "
alias "n110" "say I would love a cup. Hey, you want rum cake? - I shouldn't. - Have some. - No, I can't. - Come on! I'm trying to lose a couple"
alias "n111" "say micrograms. - Where? - These stripes don't help. You look great! I don't know if you know anything about fashion. Are you all"
alias "n112" "say right? No. He's making the tie in the cab as they're flying up Madison. He finally gets there. He runs up the steps into the"
alias "n113" "say church. The wedding is on. And he says, "Watermelon? I thought you said Guatemalan. Why would I marry a watermelon?" Is that a "
alias "n114" "say bee joke? That's the kind of stuff we do. Yeah, different. So, what are you gonna do, Barry? About work? I don't know. I want"
alias "n115" "say to do my part for the hive, but I can't do it the way they want. I know how you feel. - You do? - Sure. My parents wanted me to"
alias "n116" "say be a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist. - Really? - My only interest is flowers. Our new queen was just elected "
alias "n117" "say with that same campaign slogan. Anyway, if you look... There's my hive right there. See it? You're in Sheep Meadow! Yes! I'm"
alias "n118" "say right off the Turtle Pond! No way! I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once. - Why do girls put rings on their toes? -"
alias "n119" "say Why not? - It's like putting a hat on your knee. - Maybe I'll try that. - You all right, ma'am? - Oh, yeah. Fine. Just having"
alias "n120" "say two cups of coffee! Anyway, this has been great. Thanks for the coffee. Yeah, it's no trouble. Sorry I couldn't finish it. If"
alias "n121" "say I did, I'd be up the rest of my life. Are you...? Can I take a piece of this with me? Sure! Here, have a crumb. - Thanks! -"
alias "n122" "say Yeah. All right. Well, then... I guess I'll see you around. Or not. OK, Barry. And thank you so much again... for before. "
alias "n123" "say Oh, that? That was nothing. Well, not nothing, but... Anyway... This can't possibly work. He's all set to go. We may as well"
alias "n124" "say try it. OK, Dave, pull the chute. - Sounds amazing. - It was amazing! It was the scariest, happiest moment of my life. Humans! "
alias "n125" "say I can't believe you were with humans! Giant, scary humans! What were they like? Huge and crazy. They talk crazy. They eat crazy"
alias "n126" "say giant things. They drive crazy. - Do they try and kill you, like on TV? - Some of them. But some of them don't. - How'd you get"
alias "n127" "say back? - Poodle. You did it, and I'm glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see. You had your "experience." Now you can pick out"
alias "n128" "say your job and be normal. - Well... - Well? Well, I met someone. You did? Was she Bee-ish? - A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!"
alias "n129" "say No, no, no, not a wasp. - Spider? - I'm not attracted to spiders. I know it's the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all."
alias "n130" "say I can't get by that face. So who is she? She's... human. No, no. That's a bee law. You wouldn't break a bee law. - Her name's"
alias "n131" "say Vanessa. - Oh, boy. She's so nice. And she's a florist! Oh, no! You're dating a human florist! We're not dating. You're flying "
alias "n132" "say outside the hive, talking to humans that attack our homes with power washers and M-80s! One-eighth a stick of dynamite! She"
alias "n133" "say saved my life! And she understands me. This is over! Eat this. This is not over! What was that? - They call it a crumb. - It"
alias "n134" "say was so stingin' stripey! And that's not what they eat. That's what falls off what they eat! - You know what a Cinnabon is? -"
alias "n135" "say No. It's bread and cinnamon and frosting. They heat it up... Sit down! ...really hot! - Listen to me! We are not them! We're"
alias "n136" "say us. There's us and there's them! Yes, but who can deny the heart that is yearning? There's no yearning. Stop yearning. Listen"
alias "n137" "say to me! You have got to start thinking bee, my friend. Thinking bee! - Thinking bee. - Thinking bee. Thinking bee! Thinking bee!"
alias "n138" "say Thinking bee! Thinking bee! There he is. He's in the pool. You know what your problem is, Barry? I gotta start thinking bee?"
alias "n139" "say How much longer will this go on? It's been three days! Why aren't you working? I've got a lot of big life decisions to think"
alias "n140" "say about. What life? You have no life! You have no job. You're barely a bee! Would it kill you to make a little honey? Barry, come"
alias "n141" "say out. Your father's talking to you. Martin, would you talk to him? Barry, I'm talking to you! You coming? Got everything? All"
alias "n142" "say set! Go ahead. I'll catch up. Don't be too long. Watch this! Vanessa! - We're still here. - I told you not to yell at him. He"
alias "n143" "say doesn't respond to yelling! - Then why yell at me? - Because you don't listen! I'm not listening to this. Sorry, I've gotta go."
alias "n144" "say - Where are you going? - I'm meeting a friend. A girl? Is this why you can't decide? Bye. I just hope she's Bee-ish. They have "
alias "n145" "say a huge parade of flowers every year in Pasadena? To be in the Tournament of Roses, that's every florist's dream! Up on a float,"
alias "n146" "say surrounded by flowers, crowds cheering. A tournament. Do the roses compete in athletic events? No. All right, I've got one. How"
alias "n147" "say come you don't fly everywhere? It's exhausting. Why don't you run everywhere? It's faster. Yeah, OK, I see, I see. All right,"
alias "n148" "say your turn. TiVo. You can just freeze live TV? That's insane! You don't have that? We have Hivo, but it's a disease. It's a"
alias "n149" "say horrible, horrible disease. Oh, my. Dumb bees! You must want to sting all those jerks. We try not to sting. It's usually fatal "
alias "n150" "say for us. So you have to watch your temper. Very carefully. You kick a wall, take a walk, write an angry letter and throw it out."
alias "n151" "say Work through it like any emotion: Anger, jealousy, lust. Oh, my goodness! Are you OK? Yeah. - What is wrong with you?! - It's a"
alias "n152" "say bug. He's not bothering anybody. Get out of here, you creep! What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular? Yeah, it was. How did you "
alias "n153" "say know? It felt like about 10 pages. Seventy-five is pretty much our limit. You've really got that down to a science. - I lost a "
alias "n154" "say cousin to Italian Vogue. - I'll bet. What in the name of Mighty Hercules is this? How did this get here? Oute Bee, Golden "
alias "n155" "say Blossom, Ray Liotta Private Select? - Is he that actor? - I never heard of him. - Why is this here? - For people. We eat it."
alias "n156" "say You don't have enough food of your own? - Well, yes. - How do you get it? - Bees make it. - I know who makes it! And it's hard "
alias "n157" "say to make it! There's heating, cooling, stirring. You need a whole Krelman thing! - It's organic. - It's our-ganic! It's just"
alias "n158" "say honey, Barry. Just what?! Bees don't know about this! This is stealing! A lot of stealing! You've taken our homes, schools,"
alias "n159" "say hospitals! This is all we have! And it's on sale?! I'm getting to the bottom of this. I'm getting to the bottom of all of this!"
alias "n160" "say Hey, Hector. - You almost done? - Almost. He is here. I sense it. Well, I guess I'll go home now and just leave this nice honey"
alias "n161" "say out, with no one around. You're busted, box boy! I knew I heard something. So you can talk! I can talk. And now you'll start"
alias "n162" "say talking! Where you getting the sweet stuff? Who's your supplier? I don't understand. I thought we were friends. The last thing "
alias "n163" "say we want to do is upset bees! You're too late! It's ours now! You, sir, have crossed the wrong sword! You, sir, will be lunch"
alias "n164" "say for my iguana, Ignacio! Where is the honey coming from? Tell me where! Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms! Orazy person!"
alias "n165" "say What horrible thing has happened here? These faces, they never knew what hit them. And now they're on the road to nowhere! Just"
alias "n166" "say keep still. What? You're not dead? Do I look dead? They will wipe anything that moves. Where you headed? To Honey Farms. I am"
alias "n167" "say onto something huge here. I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood, crazy stuff. Blows your head off! I'm going to Tacoma. - And you?"
alias "n168" "say - He really is dead. All right. Uh-oh! - What is that?! - Oh, no! - A wiper! Triple blade! - Triple blade? Jump on! It's your"
alias "n169" "say only chance, bee! Why does everything have to be so doggone clean?! How much do you people need to see?! Open your eyes! Stick "
alias "n170" "say your head out the window! From NPR News in Washington, I'm Carl Kasell. But don't kill no more bugs! - Bee! - Moose blood guy!!"
alias "n171" "say - You hear something? - Like what? Like tiny screaming. Turn off the radio. Whassup, bee boy? Hey, Blood. Just a row of honey"
alias "n172" "say jars, as far as the eye could see. Wow! I assume wherever this truck goes is where they're getting it. I mean, that honey's"
alias "n173" "say ours. - Bees hang tight. - We're all jammed in. It's a close community. Not us, man. We on our own. Every mosquito on his own. "
alias "n174" "say- What if you get in trouble? - You a mosquito, you in trouble. Nobody likes us. They just smack. See a mosquito, smack, smack"
alias "n175" "say ! At least you're out in the world. You must meet girls. Mosquito girls try to trade up, get with a moth, dragonfly. Mosquito"

alias "n177" "say Mooseblood! I knew I'd catch y'all down here. Did you bring your crazy straw? We throw it in jars, slap a label on it, and it's" 
alias "n178" "say pretty much pure profit. What is this place? A bee's got a brain the size of a pinhead. They are pinheads! Pinhead. - Check out"

alias "n182" "say fake hive with fake walls? Our queen was moved here. We had no choice. This is your queen? That's a man in women's clothes!"
alias "n183" "say That's a drag queen! What is this? Oh, no! There's hundreds of them! Bee honey. Our honey is being brazenly stolen on a massive"
alias "n184" "say scale! This is worse than anything bears have done! I intend to do something. Oh, Barry, stop. Who told you humans are taking"
alias "n185" "say our honey? That's a rumor. Do these look like rumors? That's a conspiracy theory. These are obviously doctored photos. How did "
alias "n186" "say you get mixed up in this? He's been talking to humans. - What? - Talking to humans?! He has a human girlfriend. And they make"
alias "n187" "say out! Make out? Barry! We do not. - You wish you could. - Whose side are you on? The bees! I dated a cricket once in San"
alias "n188" "say Antonio. Those crazy legs kept me up all night. Barry, this is what you want to do with your life? I want to do it for all our "
alias "n189" "say lives. Nobody works harder than bees! Dad, I remember you coming home so overworked your hands were still stirring. You"
alias "n190" "say couldn't stop. I remember that. What right do they have to our honey? We live on two cups a year. They put it in lip balm for"
alias "n191" "say no reason whatsoever! Even if it's true, what can one bee do? Sting them where it really hurts. In the face! The eye! - That"
alias "n192" "say would hurt. - No. Up the nose? That's a killer. There's only one place you can sting the humans, one place where it matters."
alias "n193" "say Hive at Five, the hive's only full-hour action news source. No more bee beards! With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk. Weather"
alias "n194" "say with Storm Stinger. Sports with Buzz Larvi. And Jeanette Chung. - Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble. - And I'm Jeanette Chung. "
alias "n195" "say A tri-county bee, Barry Benson, intends to sue the human race for stealing our honey, packaging it and profiting from it"
alias "n196" "say illegally! Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King, we'll have three former queens here in our studio, discussing their new book,"
alias "n197" "say Classy Ladies, out this week on Hexagon. Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson. Did you ever think, "I'm a kid from the hive."
alias "n198" "say I can't do this"? Bees have never been afraid to change the world. What about Bee Columbus? Bee Gandhi? Bejesus? Where I'm"
alias "n199" "say from, we'd never sue humans. We were thinking of stickball or candy stores. How old are you? The bee community is supporting"
alias "n200" "say you in this case, which will be the trial of the bee century. You know, they have a Larry King in the human world too. It's a"
alias "n201" "say common name. Next week... He looks like you and has a show and suspenders and colored dots... Next week... Glasses, quotes on"
alias "n202" "say the bottom from the guest even though you just heard 'em. Bear Week next week! They're scary, hairy and here live. Always leans"
alias "n203" "say forward, pointy shoulders, squinty eyes, very Jewish. In tennis, you attack at the point of weakness! It was my grandmother,"
alias "n204" "say Ken. She's 81. Honey, her backhand's a joke! I'm not gonna take advantage of that? Quiet, please. Actual work going on here."
alias "n205" "say - Is that that same bee? - Yes, it is! I'm helping him sue the human race. - Hello. - Hello, bee. This is Ken. Yeah, I remember"
alias "n206" "say you. Timberland, size ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe. Why does he talk again? Listen, you better go 'cause we're really"
alias "n207" "say busy working. But it's our yogurt night! Bye-bye. Why is yogurt night so difficult?! You poor thing. You two have been at this "
alias "n208" "say for hours! Yes, and Adam here has been a huge help. - Frosting... - How many sugars? Just one. I try not to use the"
alias "n209" "say competition. So why are you helping me? Bees have good qualities. And it takes my mind off the shop. Instead of flowers, people"
alias "n210" "say are giving balloon bouquets now. Those are great, if you're three. And artificial flowers. - Oh, those just get me psychotic! -"
alias "n211" "say Yeah, me too. Bent stingers, pointless pollination. Bees must hate those fake things! Nothing worse than a daffodil that's had "
alias "n212" "say work done. Maybe this could make up for it a little bit. - This lawsuit's a pretty big deal. - I guess. You sure you want to go"
alias "n213" "say through with it? Am I sure? When I'm done with the humans, they won't be able to say, 3.14159Honey, I'm home,3.14159 without pa"
alias "n214" "say ying a royalty! It's an incredible scene here in downtown Manhattan, where the world anxiously waits, because for the first "
alias "n215" "say time in history, we will hear for ourselves if a honeybee can actually speak. What have we gotten into here, Barry? It's pretty"
alias "n216" "say big, isn't it? I can't believe how many humans don't work during the day. You think billion-dollar multinational food companies"
alias "n217" "say have good lawyers? Everybody needs to stay behind the barricade. - What's the matter? - I don't know, I just got a chill. Well,"
alias "n218" "say if it isn't the bee team. You boys work on this? All rise! The Honorable Judge Bumbleton presiding. All right. Case number 4475"
alias "n219" "say Superior Court of New York, Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry is now in session. Mr. Montgomery, you're representing the"
alias "n220" "say five food companies collectively? A privilege. Mr. Benson... you're representing all the bees of the world? I'm kidding. Yes,"
alias "n221" "say Your Honor, we're ready to proceed. Mr. Montgomery, your opening statement, please. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my"
alias "n222" "say grandmother was a simple woman. Born on a farm, she believed it was man's divine right to benefit from the bounty of nature"
alias "n223" "say God put before us. If we lived in the topsy-turvy world Mr. Benson imagines, just think of what would it mean. I would have to "
alias "n224" "say negotiate with the silkworm for the elastic in my britches! Talking bee! How do we know this isn't some sort of holographic"
alias "n225" "say motion-picture-capture Hollywood wizardry? They could be using laser beams! Robotics! Ventriloquism! Cloning! For all we know, "
alias "n226" "say he could be on steroids! Mr. Benson? Ladies and gentlemen, there's no trickery here. I'm just an ordinary bee. Honey's pretty"
alias "n227" "say important to me. It's important to all bees. We invented it! We make it. And we protect it with our lives. Unfortunately, there"
alias "n228" "say are some people in this room who think they can take it from us 'cause we're the little guys! I'm hoping that, after this is"
alias "n229" "say all over, you'll see how, by taking our honey, you not only take everything we have but everything we are! I wish he'd dress"
alias "n230" "say like that all the time. So nice! Call your first witness. So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden of Honey Farms, big company you have."
alias "n231" "say I suppose so. I see you also own Honeyburton and Honron! Yes, they provide beekeepers for our farms. Beekeeper. I find that to "
alias "n232" "say be a very disturbing term. I don't imagine you employ any bee-free-ers, do you? - No. - I couldn't hear you. - No. - No."
alias "n233" "say Because you don't free bees. You keep bees. Not only that, it seems you thought a bear would be an appropriate image for a jar "
alias "n234" "say of honey. They're very lovable creatures. Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear. You mean like this? Bears kill bees! How'd you "
alias "n235" "say like his head crashing through your living room?! Biting into your couch! Spitting out your throw pillows! OK, that's enough."
alias "n236" "say Take him away. So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here. Your name intrigues me. - Where have I heard it before? - I was with a "
alias "n237" "say band called The Police. But you've never been a police officer, have you? No, I haven't. No, you haven't. And so here we have"
alias "n238" "say yet another example of bee culture casually stolen by a human for nothing more than a prance-about stage name. Oh, please. Have"
alias "n239" "say you ever been stung, Mr. Sting? Because I'm feeling a little stung, Sting. Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner! That's not "
alias "n240" "say his real name?! You idiots! Mr. Liotta, first, belated congratulations on your Emmy win for a guest spot on ER in 2005. Thank"
alias "n241" "say you. Thank you. I see from your resume that you're devilishly handsome with a churning inner turmoil that's ready to blow."
alias "n242" "say I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime? Not yet it isn't. But is this what it's come to for you? Exploiting tiny, helpless bees"
alias "n243" "say so you don't have to rehearse your part and learn your lines, sir? Watch it, Benson! I could blow right now! This isn't a "
alias "n244" "say goodfella. This is a badfella! Why doesn't someone just step on this creep, and we can all go home?! - Order in this court! -"
alias "n245" "say You're all thinking it! Order! Order, I say! - Say it! - Mr. Liotta, please sit down! I think it was awfully nice of that bear "
alias "n246" "say to pitch in like that. I think the jury's on our side. Are we doing everything right, legally? I'm a florist. Right. Well,"
alias "n247" "say here's to a great team. To a great team! Well, hello. - Ken! - Hello. I didn't think you were coming. No, I was just late."
alias "n248" "say I tried to call, but... the battery. I didn't want all this to go to waste, so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free. Oh, that"
alias "n249" "say was lucky. There's a little left. I could heat it up. Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever. So I hear you're quite a tennis player."
alias "n250" "say I'm not much for the game myself. The ball's a little grabby. That's where I usually sit. Right... there. Ken, Barry was"
alias "n251" "say looking at your resume, and he agreed with me that eating with chopsticks isn't really a special skill. You think I don't see"
alias "n252" "say what you're doing? I know how hard it is to find the rightjob. We have that in common. Do we? Bees have 100 percent employment,"
alias "n253" "say but we do jobs like taking the crud out. That's just what I was thinking about doing. Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor for"
alias "n254" "say his fuzz. I hope that was all right. I'm going to drain the old stinger. Yeah, you do that. Look at that. You know, I've just"
alias "n255" "say about had it with your little mind games. - What's that? - Italian Vogue. Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages. A lot of ads. "
alias "n256" "say Remember what Van said, why is your life more valuable than mine? Funny, I just can't seem to recall that! I think something"
alias "n257" "say stinks in here! I love the smell of flowers. How do you like the smell of flames?! Not as much. Water bug! Not taking sides!"
alias "n258" "say Ken, I'm wearing a Chapstick hat! This is pathetic! I've got issues! Well, well, well, a royal flush! - You're bluffing. -"
alias "n259" "say Am I? Surf's up, dude! Poo water! That bowl is gnarly. Except for those dirty yellow rings! Kenneth! What are you doing?! You"
alias "n260" "say know, I don't even like honey! I don't eat it! We need to talk! He's just a little bee! And he happens to be the nicest bee"
alias "n261" "say I've met in a long time! Long time? What are you talking about?! Are there other bugs in your life? No, but there are other"
alias "n262" "say things bugging me in life. And you're one of them! Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night... My nerves are fried from riding on"
alias "n263" "say this emotional roller coaster! Goodbye, Ken. And for your information, I prefer sugar-free, artificial sweeteners made by man! "
alias "n264" "say I'm sorry about all that. I know it's got an aftertaste! I like it! I always felt there was some kind of barrier between Ken"
alias "n265" "say and me. I couldn't overcome it. Oh, well. Are you OK for the trial? I believe Mr. Montgomery is about out of ideas. We would"
alias "n266" "say like to call Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand. Good idea! You can really see why he's considered one of the best lawyers..."
alias "n267" "say Yeah. Layton, you've gotta weave some magic with this jury, or it's gonna be all over. Don't worry. The only thing I have to"
alias "n268" "say do to turn this jury around is to remind them of what they don't like about bees. - You got the tweezers? - Are you allergic?"
alias "n269" "say Only to losing, son. Only to losing. Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you what I think we'd all like to know. What exactly is your"
alias "n270" "say relationship to that woman? We're friends. - Good friends? - Yes. How good? Do you live together? Wait a minute... Are you her "
alias "n271" "say little... ...bedbug? I've seen a bee documentary or two. From what I understand, doesn't your queen give birth to all the bee"
alias "n272" "say children? - Yeah, but... - So those aren't your real parents! - Oh, Barry... - Yes, they are! Hold me back! You're an"
alias "n273" "say illegitimate bee, aren't you, Benson? He's denouncing bees! Don't y'all date your cousins? - Objection! - I'm going to"
alias "n274" "say pincushion this guy! Adam, don't! It's what he wants! Oh, I'm hit!! Oh, lordy, I am hit! Order! Order! The venom! The venom"
alias "n275" "say is coursing through my veins! I have been felled by a winged beast of destruction! You see? You can't treat them like equals!"
alias "n276" "say They're striped savages! Stinging's the only thing they know! It's their way! - Adam, stay with me. - I can't feel my legs."
alias "n277" "say What angel of mercy will come forward to suck the poison from my heaving buttocks? I will have order in this court. Order!"
alias "n278" "say Order, please! The case of the honeybees versus the human race took a pointed turn against the bees yesterday when one of their"
alias "n279" "say legal team stung Layton T. Montgomery. - Hey, buddy. - Hey. - Is there much pain? - Yeah. I... I blew the whole case, didn't I?"
alias "n280" "say It doesn't matter. What matters is you're alive. You could have died. I'd be better off dead. Look at me. They got it from the "
alias "n281" "say cafeteria downstairs, in a tuna sandwich. Look, there's a little celery still on it. What was it like to sting someone? I can't"
alias "n282" "say explain it. It was all... All adrenaline and then... and then ecstasy! All right. You think it was all a trap? Of course. I'm"
alias "n283" "say sorry. I flew us right into this. What were we thinking? Look at us. We're just a couple of bugs in this world. What will the"
alias "n284" "say humans do to us if they win? I don't know. I hear they put the roaches in motels. That doesn't sound so bad. Adam, they check"
alias "n285" "say in, but they don't check out! Oh, my. Could you get a nurse to close that window? - Why? - The smoke. Bees don't smoke. Right. "
alias "n286" "say Bees don't smoke. Bees don't smoke! But some bees are smoking. That's it! That's our case! It is? It's not over? Get dressed."
alias "n287" "say I've gotta go somewhere. Get back to the court and stall. Stall any way you can. And assuming you've done step correctly, "
alias "n288" "say you're ready for the tub. Mr. Flayman. Yes? Yes, Your Honor! Where is the rest of your team? Well, Your Honor, it's"
alias "n289" "say interesting. Bees are trained to fly haphazardly, and as a result, we don't make very good time. I actually heard a funny "
alias "n290" "say story about... Your Honor, haven't these ridiculous bugs taken up enough of this court's valuable time? How much longer will"
alias "n291" "say we allow these absurd shenanigans to go on? They have presented no compelling evidence to support their charges against my"
alias "n292" "say clients, who run legitimate businesses. I move for a complete dismissal of this entire case! Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going "
alias "n293" "say to have to consider Mr. Montgomery's motion. But you can't! We have a terrific case. Where is your proof? Where is the"
alias "n294" "say evidence? Show me the smoking gun! Hold it, Your Honor! You want a smoking gun? Here is your smoking gun. What is that? It's a "
alias "n295" "say bee smoker! What, this? This harmless little contraption? This couldn't hurt a fly, let alone a bee. Look at what has happened "
alias "n296" "say to bees who have never been asked, 3.14159Smoking or non?3.14159 Is this what nature intended for us? To be forcibly addicted" 
alias "n297" "say to smoke machines and man-made wooden slat work camps? Living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man? - What are we "
alias "n298" "say gonna do? - He's playing the species card. Ladies and gentlemen, please, free these bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free" 
alias "n299" "say the bees! Freethe bees! Free the bees! The court finds in favor of the bees! Vanessa, we won! I knew you could do it! "
alias "n300" "say High-five! Sorry. I'm OK! You know what this means? All the honey will finally belong to the bees. Now we won't have to work "
alias "n301" "say so hard all the time. This is an unholy perversion of the balance of nature, Benson. You'll regret this. Barry, how much honey"
alias "n302" "say is out there? All right. One at a time. Barry, who are you wearing? My sweater is Ralph Lauren, and I have no pants. - What if" 
alias "n303" "say Montgomery's right? - What do you mean? We've been living the bee way a long time, 27 million years. Congratulations on your "
alias "n304" "say victory. What will you demand as a settlement? First, we'll demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps. Then we want back"
alias "n305" "say the honey that was ours to begin with, every last drop. We demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more than"
alias "n306" "say a filthy, smelly, bad-breath stink machine. We're all aware of what they do in the woods. Wait for my signal. Take him out. "
alias "n307" "say He'll be nauseous for a few hours, then he'll be fine. And we will no longer tolerate bee-negative nicknames... But it's just a"
alias "n308" "say prance-about stage name! ...unnecessary inclusion of honey in bogus health products and la-dee-da human tea-time snack"
alias "n309" "say garnishments. Can't breathe. Bring it in, boys! Hold it right there! Good. Tap it. Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups,"
alias "n310" "say and there's gallons more coming! - I think we need to shut down! - Shut down? We've never shut down. Shut down honey"
alias "n311" "say production! Stop making honey! Turn your key, sir! What do we do now? Cannonball! We're shutting honey production! Mission"
alias "n312" "say abort. Aborting pollination and nectar detail. Returning to base. Adam, you wouldn't believe how much honey was out there. Oh, "
alias "n313" "say yeah? What's going on? Where is everybody? - Are they out celebrating? - They're home. They don't know what to do. Laying out, "
alias "n314" "say sleeping in. I heard your Uncle Carl was on his way to San Antonio with a cricket. At least we got our honey back. Sometimes I "
alias "n315" "say think, so what if humans liked our honey? Who wouldn't? It's the greatest thing in the world! I was excited to be part of "
alias "n316" "say making it. This was my new desk. This was my new job. I wanted to do it really well. And now... Now I can't. I don't understand"
alias "n317" "say why they're not happy. I thought their lives would be better! They're doing nothing. It's amazing. Honey really changes people." 
alias "n318" "say You don't have any idea what's going on, do you? - What did you want to show me? - This. What happened here? That is not the"
alias "n319" "say half of it. Oh, no. Oh, my. They're all wilting. Doesn't look very good, does it? No. And whose fault do you think that is? You" 
alias "n320" "say know, I'm gonna guess bees. Bees? Specifically, me. I didn't think bees not needing to make honey would affect all these"
alias "n321" "say things. It's notjust flowers. Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees. That's our whole SAT test right there. Take away produce," 
alias "n322" "say that affects the entire animal kingdom. And then, of course... The human species? So if there's no more pollination, it could"
alias "n323" "say all just go south here, couldn't it? I know this is also partly my fault. How about a suicide pact? How do we do it? - I'll"
alias "n324" "say sting you, you step on me. - Thatjust kills you twice. Right, right. Listen, Barry... sorry, but I gotta get going. I had to"
alias "n325" "say open my mouth and talk. Vanessa? Vanessa? Why are you leaving? Where are you going? To the final Tournament of Roses parade in "
alias "n326" "say Pasadena. They've moved it to this weekend because all the flowers are dying. It's the last chance I'll ever have to see it."
alias "n327" "say Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry. I never meant it to turn out like this. I know. Me neither. Tournament of Roses. Roses"
alias "n328" "say can't do sports. Wait a minute. Roses. Roses? Roses! Vanessa! Roses?! Barry? - Roses are flowers! - Yes, they are. Flowers,"
alias "n329" "say bees, pollen! I know. That's why this is the last parade. Maybe not. Could you ask him to slow down? Could you slow down? "
alias "n330" "say Barry! OK, I made a huge mistake. This is a total disaster, all my fault. Yes, it kind of is. I've ruined the planet. I wanted "
alias "n331" "say to help you with the flower shop. I've made it worse. Actually, it's completely closed down. I thought maybe you were"
alias "n332" "say remodeling. But I have another idea, and it's greater than my previous ideas combined. I don't want to hear it! All right, they"
alias "n333" "say have the roses, the roses have the pollen. I know every bee, plant and flower bud in this park. All we gotta do is get what"
alias "n334" "say they've got back here with what we've got. - Bees. - Park. - Pollen! - Flowers. - Repollination! - Across the nation!"
alias "n335" "say Tournament of Roses, Pasadena, California. They've got nothing but flowers, floats and cotton candy. Security will be tight."
alias "n336" "say I have an idea. Vanessa Bloome, FTD. Official floral business. It's real. Sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch. Thank you. It was a gift. "
alias "n337" "say Once inside, we just pick the right float. How about The Princess and the Pea? I could be the princess, and you could be the"
alias "n338" "say pea! Yes, I got it. - Where should I sit? - What are you? - I believe I'm the pea. - The pea? It goes under the mattresses. -"
alias "n339" "say Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart. - I'm getting the marshal. You do that! This whole parade is a fiasco! Let's see what this "
alias "n340" "say baby'll do. Hey, what are you doing?! Then all we do is blend in with traffic... ...without arousing suspicion. Once at the"
alias "n341" "say airport, there's no stopping us. Stop! Security. - You and your insect pack your float? - Yes. Has it been in your possession"
alias "n342" "say the entire time? Would you remove your shoes? - Remove your stinger. - It's part of me. I know. Just having some fun. Enjoy"
alias "n343" "say your flight. Then if we're lucky, we'll have just enough pollen to do the job. Can you believe how lucky we are? We have just"
alias "n344" "say enough pollen to do the job! I think this is gonna work. It's got to work. Attention, passengers, this is Captain Scott. We"
alias "n345" "say have a bit of bad weather in New York. It looks like we'll experience a couple hours delay. Barry, these are cut flowers with"
alias "n346" "say no water. They'll never make it. I gotta get up there and talk to them. Be careful. Can I get help with the Sky Mall magazine? "
alias "n347" "say I'd like to order the talking inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer. Captain, I'm in a real situation. - What'd you say, Hal? - "
alias "n348" "say Nothing. Bee! Don't freak out! My entire species... What are you doing? - Wait a minute! I'm an attorney! - Who's an attorney? "
alias "n349" "say Don't move. Oh, Barry. Good afternoon, passengers. This is your captain. Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B please report to"
alias "n350" "say the cockpit? And please hurry! What happened here? There was a DustBuster, a toupee, a life raft exploded. One's bald, one's"
alias "n351" "say in a boat, they're both unconscious! - Is that another bee joke? - No! No one's flying the plane! This is JFK control tower,"
alias "n352" "say Flight 356. What's your status? This is Vanessa Bloome. I'm a florist from New York. Where's the pilot? He's unconscious, and"
alias "n353" "say so is the copilot. Not good. Does anyone onboard have flight experience? As a matter of fact, there is. - Who's that? - Barry"
alias "n354" "say Benson. From the honey trial?! Oh, great. Vanessa, this is nothing more than a big metal bee. It's got giant wings, huge"
alias "n355" "say engines. I can't fly a plane. - Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot? - Yes. How hard could it be? Wait, Barry! We're headed"
alias "n356" "say into some lightning. This is Bob Bumble. We have some late-breaking news from JFK Airport, where a suspenseful scene is"
